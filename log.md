# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 29, 2020 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Today, I tried to get most of the resources I would be needing for the 100 days of code journey. I tried to get a start on creating a chatbot but had issues as I could not install tensorflow in my venv. I've put the chatbot project aside for now and hopefully will get back to it later.
I have settled to learn Html , CSS and React.

**Thoughts:** This is going to be a fun ride.

### Day 1: November 30, 2020 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Today, I Started learning Html.
Didn't learn much but I now have a good idea of tags, children, basic HTML formatting.

**Thoughts:** I honestly found it a bit boring, I've always been one to skip the little basics and jump right into the fun, but this time I want my learning to be thorough.

### Day 2: November 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today, I did a python project.
I wrote a script that generates random articles from wikipedia, lets you view current events on wikipedia and also read articles from a specific month and year e,g June 2003.


**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed writing this code,it was a real pleasure.It still needs to be fine tuned though and I'm thinking of how to wrap it up in a GUI like tkinter to make it more interactive.
